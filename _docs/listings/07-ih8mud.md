**Body:**

FOR SALE: 2021 Turtleback Expedition T3 Overland Trailer

**Location:** Savannah/Brunswick, Georgia, USA

**Price:** $34,900

2nd owner, under 25k miles, excellent condition. Always garaged, no accidents, no leaks. This is a fully-loaded T3 with the full factory package plus upgrades — a true 4-season, camp-ready rig. Tows beautifully behind any mid-size or full-size truck/SUV (I've towed it with a 4Runner and a Tacoma, no issues).

**Factory T3 Package:**
- Max Coupler hitch with adjustable height
- ICON suspension with remote reservoirs
- Xantrex 2000W pure sine inverter
- Composite kitchen module
- Heavy-duty roof rack system

**Tent & Shelter:**
- Bush Company Alpha clamshell rooftop tent (sleeps 2)
- 270XT Max awning with built-in LED lighting — coverage on three sides

**Heating/Comfort:**
- Webasto Air Top 2000 STC diesel heater, ducted directly to tent
- Exped MegaMat Max Duo 15 LW+ mattress (replaces factory foam)

**Water & Shower:**
- 40-gallon onboard tank
- Guzzle H2O built-in filtration/purification system
- 23Zero Peregrine vehicle shower enclosure
- Dometic 6-gallon hot water heater (brand new 2022, propane + electric, 10,000 BTU)

**Power System (full Victron ecosystem):**
- Dual RELiON heated lithium batteries
- Victron SmartSolar MPPT charge controller
- Victron Battery Monitor
- Sunflare XPLOR 180W roof-mounted solar panel
- Charges from vehicle, solar, and shore power

**Galley:**
- National Luna NL60 dual-zone fridge/freezer on slide-out tray
- Composite kitchen module with workspace

**Tires:**
- BFGoodrich KO2 All-Terrain (excellent condition)

**Modifications:**
- Factory interior divider panel (between fridge compartment and systems area) has been removed for easier field access to water tank, plumbing, and electrical systems. Visible in photos.

**Other Notes:**
- Hot water heater was replaced in 2022 (previous owner failed to winterize; current Dometic unit is brand new, zero issues)
- New Turtleback Expedition trailers start at $45,000+ before tent, awning, or accessories. This is a $60k+ equivalent rig.

**Delivery:** Included within 100 miles. $1/mile up to 300 miles from Savannah/Brunswick.
