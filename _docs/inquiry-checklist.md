## Red Flags — Walk Away

- Won't confirm tow vehicle specs
- "Can you just send more pics?" (after video sent)
- Wants to "come look" with no price discussion
- No brake controller, won't get one
- Vague timeline + lots of questions = tire kicker
- Asks for significant price drop before seeing it

## Quick Response Templates

### Initial Inquiry Response

```
Thanks for reaching out! Before we schedule anything, a few quick questions:

1. What's your tow vehicle? (year/make/model, and do you have a brake controller?)
2. Are you comfortable with the $34,900 asking price?
3. What's your timeline for purchasing?

Once I have those details, I'll send you a full video walkthrough.
```

### After Qualification — Sending Video

```
Great, sounds like you're set up to tow it. Here's a 15-minute walkthrough video I shot:

[VIDEO LINK]

If you're still interested after watching, let me know and we'll schedule a time. I'm near Savannah/Brunswick, GA, and can deliver up to 300 miles.
```

### Scheduling a Showing

```
I do showings by appointment on Saturdays, 10am-2pm. The next available is [DATE]. Does that work?

If you'd prefer, I can meet halfway in Savannah or Jacksonville once we've agreed on numbers.
